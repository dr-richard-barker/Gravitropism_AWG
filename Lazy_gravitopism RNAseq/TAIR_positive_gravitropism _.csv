Gene:2175558	AT5G57090	AT5G57090.1	protein_coding	Encodes an auxin efflux carrier that is similar to bacterial membrane transporters. Root-specific role in the transport of auxin. Acts downstream of CTR1 and ethylene biosynthesis, in the same pathway as EIN2 and AUX1, and independent from EIN3 and EIN5/AIN1 pathway. In the root, the protein localizes apically in epidermal and lateral root cap cells and predominantly basally in cortical cells. Functions may be regulated by phosphorylation status. EIR1 expression is induced by brassinolide treatment in the brassinosteroid-insensitive br1 mutant. Gravistimulation results in asymmetric PIN2 distribution, with more protein degraded at the upper side of the gravistimulated root. Membrane sterol composition is essential for the acquisition of  PIN2 polarity. Its expression is downregulated at hypoxic conditions. RAP2.12 overexpression inhibits this downregulation.

Gene:2062267	AT2G34650	AT2G34650.1	protein_coding	Encodes a protein serine/threonine kinase that may act as a positive regulator of cellular auxin efflux, as a a binary switch for PIN polarity, and as a negative regulator of auxin signaling. Recessive mutants exhibit similar phenotypes as pin-formed mutants in flowers and inflorescence but distinct phenotypes in cotyledons and leaves. Expressed in the vascular tissue proximal to root and shoot meristems, shoot apex, and embryos. Expression is induced by auxin. Overexpression of the gene results in phenotypes in the root and shoot similar to those found in auxin-insensitive mutants. The protein physically interacts with TCH3 (TOUCH3) and PID-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (PBP1), a previously uncharacterized protein containing putative EF-hand calcium-binding motifs.  Acts together with ENP (ENHANCER OF PINOID) to instruct precursor cells to elaborate cotyledons in the transition stage embryo. Interacts with PDK1. PID autophosphorylation is required for the ability of PID to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate. PID activation loop is required for PDK1-dependent PID phosphorylation and requires the PIF domain. Negative regulator of root hair growth. PID kinase activity is critical for the inhibition of root hair growth and for maintaining  the proper subcellular localization of PID.

Gene:3690779	AT1G70560	AT1G70560.1	protein_coding	TAA1 is involved in the shade-induced production of indole-3-pyruvate (IPA), a precursor to IAA, a biologically active auxin. It is also involved in regulating many aspects of plant growth and development from embryogenesis to flower formation and plays a role in ethylene-mediated signaling. This enzyme can catalyze the formation of IPA from L-tryptophan. Though L-Trp is expected to be the preferred substrate in vivo, TAA1 also acts as an aminotransferase using L-Phe, L-Tyr, L-Leu, L-Ala, L-Met, and L-Gln. Lines carrying mutations in this gene are unaffected by auxin transporter inhibitor NPA. Double mutant analysis and exogenous auxin treatment suggest that this gene is required for auxin signaling during lateral root and root meristem development. The activity of TAA1 can be controlled by phosphorylation of residue T101, which, when phosphorylated results in loss of activity. TAA1 is a target of TMK4.
