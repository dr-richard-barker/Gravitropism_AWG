Gene:2182371	AT5G35220	AT5G35220.1	protein_coding	Membrane-associated and ATP-independent metalloprotease; EGY1 protein contains eight trans-membrane domains at its C-terminus, and carries out beta-casein degradation in an ATP-independent manner. EGY1 is required for development of both thylakoid grana and a well-organized lamellae system in chloroplast. Additionally, EGY1 is required for the accumulation of chlorophyll and chlorophyll a/b binding (CAB) proteins (both PS I and PS II) in chloroplast membranes, and for grana formation and normal chloroplast development. Loss of EGY1 function also has an effect on endodermal plastid biogenesis. Mutant studies suggest that EGY1 is involved in the regulation of nuclear gene expression response to ammonium stress and interacts with ABA signaling.

Homolog of EGY1. Each of the EGY1 and EGY-like proteins share two additional highly conserved motifs, the previously reported NPDG motif (aa 442–454 in EGY1, Rudner et al., 1999) and a newly defined GNLR motif (aa 171–179 in EGY1). The GNLR motif is a novel signature motif unique to EGY1 and EGY-like proteins as well as other EGY1 orthologs found in cyanobacteria.
