# Gravitropism

### Gravitropism requires the perception of gravity, its transduction into a biochemical signal, the transmission of this signal and the resulting curvature at the site of response <a href="#id-7h6r2f19lvnt" id="id-7h6r2f19lvnt"></a>

Gravitropism which is often traditionally referred to as geotropism is the movement or redirection of growth in response to gravity. It can be found in all higher plants and many lower plants as well as some types of fungi. It was first noted in the literature when Darwin (1880) reported that roots generally grow towards the earth (a phenomenon known as positive gravitropism) and that shoots generally grow away from the earth (known as negative gravitropism). The precise cause of this behaviour is unclear, but one hypothesis is that the optimal orientation angle is perpendicular to the ground and then various environmental signals can cause the plant to deviate from this genetically programmed orientation. Therefore there must be signaling networks that are capable of perceiving the gravity vector and then transmit that signal to the responding cells while integrating other environmental signals.

The perception of and response to gravi-stimulation are parts of a complex and dynamic process that is likely to involve multiple sensing mechanisms (as reviewed by Baldwin _et al_., 2013). When seedlings are turned on their side a gravity-induced curvature can first be detected in the distal elongation zone (Ishikawa and Evans, 1993). Subsequently, as the root bends down towards the gravity vector the region where differential elongation and curvature occur extends to encompass the entire elongation zone (Miller et al., 2007). Yet, gravity sensing occurs at the root tip within the highly specialized columella cells of the cap. There the potential energy of gravity is converted into a biochemical signal that can dictate tip curvature upon transmission to the site of response. Thus correct curvature requires the coordination of signal perception, intracellular transduction, intercellular signaling and differential cell expansion leading to tip curvature. In this section, we briefly discuss the molecular mechanisms that underlie each phase of this complex process.

### Gravi-perception: the Starch statolith hypothesis <a href="#eiwu2jdez337" id="eiwu2jdez337"></a>

The most widely accepted hypothesis proposed to explain gravity perception by flowering plant postulates that the sedimentation of, and/or pressure exerted by, starch-filled amyloplasts (often referred to as statoliths), is an important first step in the perception of gravity. This sedimentation somehow affects endomembrane trafficking to modulate the location and/or activity of auxin transporters, thus creating an asymmetric auxin gradient across the cap. Upon transmission to the elongation zones, this gradient would promote a differential cell elongation between upper and lower flanks leading to gravitropic curvature. However, this is a very simplistic view of a complex issue and there are many interesting molecular mechanisms such as biphasic Ca2+ fluxes from mechanosentive ion channels, inositol-5-phosphate (IP5) signaling, and apoplastic alkalization that are also required for correct roots response to gravity which provide many opportunities to integrate a plethora of environmental signals (Discussed later on).

The starch-statolith model of gravity perception originates in the realization that cells within the columella region of the root cap contain amyloplasts that are free to sediment within the gravity field. In shoots, similar specialized cells were also found in the endodermal tissue that surrounds the vasculature, and early centrifugation experiments suggested an overlap between the location of these cells within the plants and the region involved in gravity sensing (Blancaflor et al., 1998, Tsugeki and Fedoroff, 1999, Fukaki et al., 1998). Interestingly, mutants that lack correctly differentiated endodermal tissues have reduced shoot and root responses to gravi-stimulation suggesting that at least in shoots this mechanism of gravi-perception mediated by sedimating statoliths in the endodermis has an important role in coordinating growth (Fukaki et al., 1998, Helariutta et al., 2000). Also, mutants that lack starch such as _phosphoglucomutase-1_ _(pgm-1)_ have an attenuated gravity response (Kiss et al., 1989, Band et al., 2012c) whereas mutants that have excess starch in their shoot statocytes such as starch excess 1 _(sex1)_ display increased shoot gravi-sensitivity (Vitha et al., 2007).

The importance of the columella cells in gravi-sensing is also demonstrated by experiments that used laser or genetic ablation to physically eliminate all or subgroups of these cells. In such experiments, it was shown that the columella region of the cap in general, and the first two layers of columella cells in particular, are important for gravity sensing (Blancaflor et al., 1998, Tsugeki and Fedoroff, 1999). Evidence for an involvement of amyloplast movement in gravity sensing was acquired in experiments that used magnetophoresis to laterally displace them along high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMFs). This movement was sufficient to promote tip curvature in the direction of amyloplast movement in roots, and away from it in shoots, as expected based on the gravitropic response of these organs. Interestingly, starchless mutants whose amyloplasts cannot be displayed by such HGMFs anymore, lacking diamagnetic starch, did not respond anymore to the HGMF by tip curvatures, again supporting a role for starch, a very dense molecule, in gravity sensing (Kuznetsov and Hasenstein, 1996). Exactly how the sedimenting statoliths transmit gravi-percetion to the response networks is unclear; however a few models have been proposed involving mechano-sensitive ion channels, receptor-ligand interactions and actin tensegrity. The sedimentation of the statoliths modifies the flow of auxin causing its asymmetric redistribution across the root (Swarup et al., 2005).

### Mechanosensitive ion channels and Ca2+ <a href="#pfw3thx2dx4u" id="pfw3thx2dx4u"></a>

The steps linking amyloplast sedimentation and auxin redistribution are still unclear, although some of the genes involved have been uncovered in genetic screens, and their molecular analysis has suggested a role for endomembrane trafficking in this process (see below). One model for gravity signal transduction is that the pressure exerted by sedimenting amyloplasts directly on target membranes, or indirectly by pulling on actin filaments, promotes the opening of stretch-activated mechano-sensitive ion channels within those membranes, resulting in an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels within the statocyte. In turn, cytosolic Ca2+ peaks would activate a pathway that leads to lateral auxin transport (Leitz et al., 2009, Collings et al., 2001). The possible involvement of actin filaments had been suggested in what is known as the tensegrity model of gravity signal transduction. This model postulates that falling amyloplasts interact with the structural integrity of actin filaments that form a dynamic matrix that is anchored to the plasma membrane. If amyloplasts settle on this matrix they modify the tension on Ca2+ channels on the plasma membrane causing a transient increase in Ca2+ (Leitz _et al.,_ 2009). This has been investigated using pharmacological agents that affect their stability; if such actin filaments are needed to transduce the information provided by amyloplast sedimentation via stretching of Ca2+ channels associated membranes, one would expect their destabilization to decrease the plantâ€™s ability to respond to gravity. However, when plants were treated with latruncilin B or cytochalasin D as actin destabilizers, their organs actually developed an extended ability to respond to gravity (Staves et al., 1997a, Hou et al., 2004). In addition, the root columella cells of germinating flax seeds accumulate starch filled amyloplasts before developing a fully functional actin cytoskeleton. Amazingly, such roots acquire their ability to respond to gravity after having acquired sedimenting amyloplasts, but before displaying a fully developed actin cytoskeleton network in their statocytes (Ma and Hasenstein, 2006). Taken together, these results bring into question the importance of actin microfilaments in mediating the early stages of gravity perception.

Unfortunately, the possible involvement of cation-selective, mechano-sensitive ion channels in mediating early stages of gravity signal transduction in the root or shoot statocytes of flowering plants remains controversial. Early pharmacological studies using inhibitors of Ca2+ channels or sensors had suggested an important role for Ca2+ in the process. For instance, lanthanum and gadolinium, which are inhibitors of cation-selective stretch-activated ion channels (Caldwell et al., 1998), have been shown to inhibit gravitropism (Ding and Pickard, 1993). However, despite extensive research no genetic evidence has been generated to support the hypothesis of a role for mechano-sensitive ion channels in gravity sensing, although one mechano-sensitive ion channel, _MID1-COMPLEMENTING ACTIVITY 1_ (MCA1), has been implicated in thigmotropism (Nakagawa et al., 2007). The participation of cation-selective mechano-sensitive ion channels in gravity perception would cause cytosolic Ca2+ changes in statocytes in response to gravi-stimulation, however so far no cytosolic Ca2+ spikes have been observed in the statocytes of _Arabidopsis_ (Legue et al., 1997). The columella cells have been shown to express high levels of calmodulin, a Ca2+ sensor (Stinemetz et al., 1987), Therefore, it is possible that small and/or highly localized changes in cytosolic Ca2+ levels, below detection with currently available Ca2+ measurement tools, are still sufficient to trigger a response pathway within the statocytes.

Although no changes in Ca2+ dynamics have been observed in the columella cells, they have been observed in other cell types known to be involved in asymmetric auxin distribution demonstrating that Ca2+ does play a role, albeit downstream, in the gravitropic response. Plieth and Trewavas (2002) showed that cytosolic Ca2+ signalling occurred in response to gravi-stimulation and the kinetics were different when compared to those generated by mechanical stimuli such as touch. A biphasic Ca2+ flux was observed that appeared in a transient fashion and the length was proportional to the strength of the stimuli (Plieth and Trewavas, 2002). Interestingly auxin transport inhibitors were able to interfere with the gravity-induced Ca2+ fluxes, however it is likely that this is an upstream event of the auxin transport which may be positively modulated by auxin as their amplitude peaks were reduced by auxin transport inhibitors (Toyota et al., 2008). However, these Ca2+ peaks were originally derived from aerial tissues not from roots and were not at a tissue-specific resolution so it's unclear if these patterns are replicated in root tissue.

Ca2+ chelators and calmodulin (calcium-binding messenger proteins) inhibitors interfere with many aspects of plant growth and at high concentrations can inhibit root elongation so can only be used at relatively low concentrations. They have been shown to affect gravitropic growth response but were unable to distinguish whether Ca2+ signaling is involved in the early stages of gravi-perception or later downstream of auxin relocalization (BjÃ¶rkman and Cleland, 1991, Belyavskaya, 2001, Sinclair et al., 1996). Interestingly one pharmacological agent known as KN-93 was shown to inhibit calcium/calmodulin kinase II (CaMK II), this was shown to inhibit light-regulated aspects of root gravitropism but not the perception of light itself suggesting that Ca2+ signaling might also be a site of cross-talk with phototropic response pathways (Lu Y-T et al., 1993). In addition, it has recently been shown that epidermal cell cytosolic Ca2+ signaling in response to an auxin stimulus modulates apoplastic growth-related pH changes causing apoplastic alkylation in response to auxin addition/perception (Monshausen et al., 2011).

### Secondary messengers include cytoplasmic alkalization and InsP3 <a href="#pgafmfuumsmr" id="pgafmfuumsmr"></a>

Many other secondary messengers have also been suggested to contribute to signal transduction during gravitropic signaling (see recent review by Toyota and Gilroy (2013). Although Ca2+ spikes and mechano-sensitive ion channels are involved in gravi-response they have not been observed in the columella cells which are the primary site of gravi-perception. However, cytosolic pH changes and artificial alterations in columella cell pH are capable of perturbing the gravitropic response (Monshausen et al., 2011, Scott and Allen, 1999). Changes in the cytoplasmic pH one minutes after gravi-stimulation have been observed in 2nd and 3rd columella tiers using pH-sensitive dyes and transgenic GFP reporter lines as 1â€“2 minutes lasting approximately 8-12 minutes and occur in parallel with an apoplastic acidification (Fasano et al., 2001, Boonsirichai et al., 2003). Scott and Allen (1999) used chemicals that alter the pH balance of the apoplast to demonstrate that apoplastic alkalization delays gravitropism and that apoplastic acidification enhances gravitropism. However, this is downstream of gravi-perception as is demonstrated by the importance of statolith sedimentation is demonstrated by the absence of a pH spike after gravi-stimulation in the starchless _pgm1_ mutant (Fasano et al., 2001). These gravity induced pH increases observed in the cytosol were shortly followed by apoplastic acidification which is consistent with protons being pumped out of cells (Fasano et al., 2001). The gravity related cytoplasmic pH changes were also reduced in the starch-deficient mutant _pgm1-1_, suggesting that sedimentation of starch-filled amyloplasts are required for columella cell cytoplasmic alkalinization (Fasano et al., 2001). Fasano et al., (2001) used microinjection of UV-activated caged protons to counteract the protons exported from the columella cells in response to gravi-stimulation and were able to observe a significant reduction in the gravi-induced curvature. As these pH fluxes occur so fast they are an important early step gravi-sensing signal transduction and may have a role in facilitating auxin transport downstream of statolith sedimentation. Interestingly, when the root cap is mechanically stimulated the pH-dependent gravity signaling event is inhibited which reduces the roots ability to sense and respond to gravity. This interaction of the touch and gravity response systems appears to be mediated by a wave of elevated cytosolic Ca2+ that propagates from touch-stimulated cells. These observations suggest a model whereby touch and gravity coordinate root growth through the interaction of pH and Ca2+ signalling events in the columella cells. The columella may therefore represent a site where many signals are integrated and control common growth regulatory machinery.

Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (5PTases) are enzymes involved in phosphatidylinositol metabolism that affect various aspects of plant growth and development. It has been suggested that the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) pathway is another secondary signaling pathway involved in gravitropism that may be linked to Ca2+ signalling as InsP3 has been shown to be involved in releasing Ca2+ from intracellular stores in animal systems (Mikoshiba, 2007). It has also been shown that a transient increase in InsP3 can be observed within 10 s of gravi-stimulation on the lower half of oat and maize pulvini and 30 min later InsP3 fluctuation could be observed on both the upper and lower sides which eventually 8-10 hours later led to differential cell elongation became visible and IP3 levels had returned to normal (Perera et al., 1999). Studies in transgenic Arabidopsis expressing a InsP3 hydrolyzing enzyme had reduced InsP3 levels, which resulted in a reduced capacity to respond to gravi-stimulation (Perera et al., 2006). The roots of the transgenic plants were shown to have reduced Auxin transport and altered Ca2+ sensitivity demonstrating InsP3â€™s essential role in the gravity response cascade. Interestingly Perera _et al_., (2006) demonstrated that the cold memory response of these transgenic plants was also attenuated supporting earlier evidence generated from oats that InsP3 may be involved in the retention of a cold-perceived gravitropic signal (Perera et al., 2001). Recently a mutation in an enzyme involved in InsP3 metabolism, _5PT13_, had an altered response to auxin transport inhibitors. Consequently, PIN2 an auxin efflux carrier is expressed more broadly in the _5pt13_ mutant and has altered vesicular trafficking patterns affecting PIN1 localization and PIN cycling. Taken together these data suggest that IP3 signaling regulates auxin transport by influencing vesicular trafficking (Yuan et al., 2009).

### Gravi-perception: Hydrostatic pressure and the receptor ligand models <a href="#id-1pfmwvvveq2" id="id-1pfmwvvveq2"></a>

Although the â€˜amyloplast-statolithâ€™ model of gravity sensing predominates among current theories, alternative mechanisms have been suggested and deserve consideration both independently and potentially in combination with one another. The hydrostratic-pressure model suggests the pressure of the entire cell might be sensed by the statocytes which translate this force into molecular signals that guide growth (Boonsirichai et al., 2003, Staves et al., 1997b). This model was suggested due to research into cytoplasmic-streaming polarity in cells of the algae _Characean_ (Staves et al., 1997c). According to this model, cellular machinery is able to detect a pressure differential between the upper and lower sides of the statocytes caused by the weight of the entire amyloplast on the cell wall. This model is particularly interesting as there is also substantial evidence for gravity sensing outside of the columella cells that could involve an amyloplast-independent mechanism that can cause different cell elongation rates in the different regions of the root (Wolverton _et al.,_ 2002). Although Corn plants that have had their root cap removed and treated with actin depolymerizing drugs are greatly retarded, they still retain the ability to respond to changes in the gravity vector suggesting it may contribute as a secondary gravity-sensing mechanism in the root elongation zone (Mancuso et al., 2006, Wolverton et al., 2002).

The ligand-receptor model postulates that ligands on the surface of sedimenting statoliths interact with receptors in sensitive membranes on the side of the cells, thereby triggering gravity signal transduction. This model was first proposed by investigators studying gravity sensing and signal transduction by the rhizoids of _Chara_ _globularis._ These rhizoids contain BaSO4-containing vacuoles that sediment in a subapical region of the cell. To trigger a gravitropic curvature, the sedimenting statoliths have to contact a sensitive region of the plasma membrane at the cell sub-apex. However, experiments involving parabolic flights to create a microgravity environment that eliminates the ability of pre-sedimented statoliths to exert pressure on juxtaposed membranes, demonstrated that a simple contact between statoliths and sensitive membrane was sufficient to trigger a response; no pressure was necessary. This exciting observation is consistent with the ligand-receptor model of gravity signal transduction described above, and suggests that mechano-sensitive ion channels are not needed for this response (Braun, 2002) (Limbach et al., 2005). Recent genetic investigations of gravity signal transduction in Arabidopsis roots have led us to conclude that this model should also not be excluded from the discussions on gravitropism in flowering plants either.

### Intra-cellular signalling post statolith sedimentation involves ARG1, ARL2 and TOC132 <a href="#rgppg5zd3ac8" id="rgppg5zd3ac8"></a>

It is unclear exactly how the pH change is activated and perceived but recent genetic evidence is starting to unravel some of these mechanisms. The _ALTERED RESPONSE TO GRAVITY 1 (ARG1)_ and its paralog, _ARG1-LIKE 2 (ARL2),_ have been identified due to the slow response of their hypocotyls and roots to a gravi-stimulation (Sedbrook et al., 1996, Boonsirichai et al., 2003, Guan et al., 2003). These genes function non-redundantly in the early stages of gravi-perception signal transduction and may physically interact (Harrison and Masson, 2008). These mutants donâ€™t respond differently to exogenous hormones demonstrating that they are upstream of the auxin signaling pathway (Guan et al., 2003). In addition, as there are no signs of cytosolic alkalization of columella cells, nor relocalization of auxin transporters so no asymmetric auxin gradient can be observed (Boonsirichai et al., 2003, Harrison and Masson, 2008). Examining the starch content and sedimentation kinetics of the statoliths in the roots of _arg1_ demonstrated that ARG1 functions downstream of plastid sedimentation (Stanga et al., 2009, Sedbrook et al., 1996). _ARG1_ and _ARL2_ are membrane-associated J-domain proteins that localize to the endomembrane system and therefore might be involved in targeting PIN proteins or proton transporters between subcellular compartments and the plasma membrane (Sedbrook et al., 1996, Boonsirichai et al., 2003). Boonirichai _et al_., (2003) were able to rescue the root gravitropic phenotype of ARG1 using a root cap specific promoter and their hypocotyl gravity response defect using an endodermal specific promoter suggesting

\
ARG1 functions at the site of gravity perception. However, the strong enhancement of the gravitropic defect of the _arl2 pgm_ double mutant suggests _ARG1_ and _ARL2_ are in a separate genetic pathway from PGM and the reduced gravitropic response kinetics of _arg1_ is not due to abnormal amyloplast sedimentation kinetics (Guan et al., 2003). Implying that either _ARG1_ and _ARL2_ is involved in an amyloplast-independent pathway or that _pgm_ retains some statolith sedimentation and that subsequent signal transduction is further affected by their loss of expression.

A forward genetic screen looking for genetic enhancers of _arg1_ identified _toc132_ and _toc75_. These genes are components of the translocon of the outer envelope of chloroplasts (TOC) complex and can be found on the surface of the plastids (Stanga et al., 2009). The _toc75_ mutant was a hypomorph that also had pale leaves, while _toc123_ was a knockout and rarely had any obvious aerial phenotypes and as a result _toc132_ was more thoroughly characterized (Baldwin et al., 2005, Kubis et al., 2004, Stanga et al., 2009). In the _arg1 toc132_ double mutants, the statoliths in the columella cells contain the normal amount of starch and are morphologically normal and sediment with normal kinetics (Stanga et al., 2009). TOC132 may facilitate amyloplast localization of a ligand that may interact with a membrane-bound receptor (Ivanova et al., 2004).
