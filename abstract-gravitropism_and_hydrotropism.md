# Abstract: Gravitropism\_&\_Hydrotropism

## **Title: Primary root growth modulated by gravity, touch and hydrotropism.**

**Authors: Richard Barker, ... more welcome?**&#x20;

**Focus/Goal:** This review will have in-depth coverage of gravitropism and then talk about interaction of gravity with other responses such as touch, light and water. We should also write about hormones and reactive oxygen species as well other secondary signaling molecules such as Ca2+, cytosol alkalizations,

Plant root growth is a dynamic process that interacts with various environmental stimuli in order to optimize growth. Gravity is a key factor that determines the orientation of shoot and root growth. During the conversion of the potential energy of the Earthâ€™s gravitational field is converted into a molecular signal that elicits an appropriate growth response. Various other environmental signals are integrated during either the perception, transduction or response stages. In this review we discuss what is known about gravity perception in model plant species and how the plant integrates its ability to sense and respond to touch stimuli (thigmotropism) and water gradients (hydrotropism). We also discuss recent technological advances that are providing fresh insights into this fascinating subject area.
