# Phototropism

**Plants perceive the direction of incident light**

Phototropism is a directional growth response that is driven by light and was originally postulated by Chlodney and Went to be the result of the asymmetric Auxin distribution. The directional cues from both light and gravity ensure the aerial part of the plant grows upward and root grows downward into the soil, in general, roots are negatively phototropic and shoots are positively phototropic. Over the years, advances have been made in the genetic, molecular and cell biological components involved in sensing and responding to phototropic stimuli (see recent review by Briggs and Kutschera, 2012). Root growth response towards light depends on its wavelength and intensity. Plants need to integrate the light and gravity stimuli for appropriate growth response. In roots, negative phototropic curvature is enhanced by their positive gravitropic response, while in shoot the converse is true. The direction of light is perceived by the root has been shown to significantly reduce the rate of gravitropic curvature, when the light can from above the curvature occurred normally but when the lights came from below (Vitha et al., 2000). In addition, Vitha _et al_., (2000) also repeated this experiment using the starchless mutants _pgm1-1_ and _adg1-1_ which encodes a ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is a key regulatory enzyme in the starch biosynthetic pathway. These mutants plants when lit from below caused the roots to grow up away from the light source while WT plants hypocotyl and roots both grew down towards the light and the gravity vector. This demonstrated that when amyloplasts are degraded in response to an environmental signal such as drought their gravitropic perception decreases and the importance of other tropisms such as phototropism become more prevalent.



**Regulation of gravitropism by light quality**

Plants can perceive light using light receptors known as crytochromes, phototropins and red light using phytochromes such as PHYA and PHYB (Robson and Smith, 1996, Briggs et al., 2001, Ohgishi et al., 2004). Plant root perception of blue light causes them to exhibit negative phototropic response and curve away from it. Alterations to PIN1 localization after blue light treatment have been observed to contribute to the inhibition of vertical growth as directed by gravity and its effect on auxin-mediated responses (Blakeslee et al., 2004). Wan et al., (2012) used a microelectrode system to demonstrate that the blue light receptor phototropin1 (phot1) interacts with NONPHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL3 (NPH3) dephosphorylating and activating it. NPH3 then interacts with the endosomal targeting system that is responsible for the PIN2 localization. A GFP tagged PIN2 transgenic line was shown to accumulate in the vacuole-like compartments of dark-grown seedlings but this was reduced in the _nph3_ and _phot1_ mutants (Wan et al., 2012). Therefore blue light signaling requires the PHOT1/NPH3 signaling pathway and influences the direction of root growth by modifying PIN2 trafficking which alters the auxin flux through the root apex to the elongation zone.

The blue light photoreceptor phototropin 1 was isolated from _Arabidopsis_ mutants that are deficient in root phototropism (Briggs and Christe, 2002). Phototropins belong to a large family that contain LOV domain which acts as a sensor for light, oxygen and voltage (Huala _et al.,_ 1997, Zhulin and Taylor, 1997; Taylor and Zhulin, 1999; Crosson _et al.,_ 2003). The functional phototropins contain two LOV domains that are non-covalently bounded by each one of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) molecules in dark and get activated through blue light perception (Christie _et al.,_ 1998). Flavin mononucleotides contain the light-absorbing chromophore. Phot1 also has the Ser/Thr photoreceptor kinase that binds to the two FMN molecules. When phototropins get activated through light absorption, it forms a covalent adduct between the conserved C(4) atom of the FMN and a conserved cysteine residue within the LOV domain. This adduct state represents the active signalling state of the phot1, which initiates a downstream cascade of signalling events through de-repression of the carboxy-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain of the phototropin (Christie _et al.,_ 2002; Harper _et al.,_ 2003, 2004). Besides, PHOT1 localized not only in the shoot but also in the root cap (Sakamato and Briggs. 2002).

In contrast to the negative phototropic response that roots display in response to blue and white light when exposed to red light they can display a positive phototropic curvature (Ruppel et al., 2001). In order for this positive phototropic response to be observable the gravitropic phenotype had to be impaired, however, this red light-induced positive phototropic response is also weaker than the blue-light response so is not detectable in white light. To overcome the phototropism mask that gravitropism provides Kiss _et al_., (2003) invented a computer-controlled feedback-regulated rotatable stage that was linked to a real-time image acquisition tool in order to monitor root growth as it undergoes curvature in response to a light stimulus and then rotates the system to reduce the plants response to gravity. They showed that positive root phototropism occurs upon perception of red light and that this perception was dependent specifically on PHYTOCHROME (PHY) A and PHY B but not on PHYD or PHYE (Kiss et al., 2003).



**Proposed models do not explain much on the interaction between gravity and light**

Although gravitropism and phototropism are related processes, the precise mechanism of interaction between light and gravity is not completely understood. It is well known that starch-filled amyloplast sedimentation in the root cap columella cells upon gravi stimulation is the initial step is the perception of gravitropic stimuli (Sievers 1984; Barlow 1995, 2002). However, the mechanism of transmission of a physical signal to intra-cellular signal is still a matter of debate. Based on the work done by authors Vitha et al. (2000) and Correll and Kiss (2005), Boccalandro et al. (2008) illustrated a model for the effect of light on gravitropism. They have shown the involvement of photoreceptors phytochrome A and phototropin 1 in respect to root gravitropism. In this model, a plasma membrane-associated protein involved in phy A signalling (PKS1) is postulated to regulate both photo- and gravitropism in the root of Arabidopsis seedlings (Boccalandro et al. 2008). However, the role of red light-dependent protein PKS1 and phytohormone auxin in dark-grown seedlings is not known (see Laxmi et al. 2008; Li et al. 2011).

In roots, the gravity signal is perceived primarily via the root cap (Sievers 1984), whereas the perception of light signal through the root cap is still ambiguous. Most research experiments have shown that the root tip senses the light signal. However, Maize roots retain the phototropic response after removal of the root cap (Schneider 1965). The red/far-red light photoreceptor phytochrome A is localized in the root cap, and the blue light receptor phototropin 1 occurs in the elongation zone of the roots (Sakamoto and Briggs 2002). When the roots are exposed to blue light, phototropin1 absorbs a single photon which results in the generation of an excited singlet flavin mononucleotide (FMN). The resulting FMN-cysteinyl-adduct represents the active signalling state of phot-1 (‘‘Adduct state’’ of the FMN-molecule) and this reaction is reversible in darkness (Tseng and Briggs, 2010). However, the mode of signal transmission between phototropin 1 and growing cells is not known.
