# The Auxin reflux fountain model and gravi-perception signal transduction

### Auxin maxima drives root tip growth <a href="#tyfasxnc3wl8" id="tyfasxnc3wl8"></a>

In order for normal meristem organization and growth to occur, an auxin concentration maxima must occur at the QC (Sabatini et al., 1999, Petersson et al., 2009). Auxin is transported from the shoot through the vasculature by AUXIN RESISTANT1 (AUX1) influx proteins, PIN-FORMED (PIN) efflux proteins and ATP BINDING CASSETTE SUBFAMILY B - 19 (ABCB19) to the root tip (Gälweiler et al., 1998, Friml et al., 2002b, Ikram et al., 2005, Yang et al., 2006). The auxin is then imported into the QC cells and root cap cells by PIN4 (Friml et al., 2002a). Disrupting this with chemical, mechanical or genetic mutations can lead to alterations in root meristem morphology and changes to tissue specification (Xu et al., 2006, Sabatini et al., 1999). The auxin efflux model proposes that auxin from the maxima at the QC is redirected from pathways that reinforce this maxima and instead causes an asymmetric auxin gradient to occur (Konings.,1967 ). It was subsequently shown that the auxin relocalization to the bottom of the plant in response to seedling reorientation redirects auxin through the lateral root cap and epidermal cells to the elongation zone where it inhibits cell elongation (Swarup et al., 2005). This reverse fountain model describes the flow of auxin down through the center of the root tip to the columella cells, then back shootward through the lateral root cap and epidermal cells, before being recycled inward through the ground tissue and back into the stele where it starts again (Ottenschläger et al., 2003, Salisbury et al., 1988, Young et al., 1990). As it has been hypothesized that gravitropic growth responses are caused by differential auxin accumulation on opposite sides of the plant root the reverse fountain model can be adapted to allow a grate flow along the bottom side of the root after a gravitational stimulus. There is now an abundance of experimental and genetic evidence supporting the Cholodny-Went theory such as those associated with mutations in genes that affect auxin transport or response cause gravitropic defects that have recently been reviewed (Baldwin et al., 2013, Strohm et al., 2012). Transgenic lines containing reporter genes under the auxin-responsive promoters DR5 and DII-Venus have demonstrated that auxin-responsive genes are differentially activated in cells of the peripheral cap and epidermis on the bottom side of gravi-stimulated roots (Rashotte et al., 2000, Band et al., 2012c). Computer simulations have recently suggested that this polar auxin transport reflux pathway model can become self-staining and become independent of shoot-derived auxin (Petersson et al., 2009).

### Asymmetric auxin redistribution due to PIN relocalization <a href="#id-9le9jfga79wa" id="id-9le9jfga79wa"></a>

Although the details of gravi-perception are poorly understood the mechanisms that generate, transmit, maintain and perceive the auxin gradient are better understood. The sedimentation of the starch-statoliths is an important step that activates a signalling cascade that changes the distribution of auxin efflux facilitators PIN3 and PIN7. These PIN proteins mediate auxin efflux from root columella cells to the lateral root cap cells on the bottom side of the root leading to asymmetric distribution (Friml et al., 2002b, Ikram et al., 2005). Analysis of the polar localization of the auxin transport facilitator PIN3 and the _pin3_ mutant phenotypes strongly supports the Cholodny-Went theory, as the mutant _pin3_ mutant has perturbed gravitropic reorientation kinetics (Ji et al., 2002). The resulting lateral auxin gradient at the root tip is transported shootward to the elongation zone in cortical and epidermal cell by PIN2 and ABCB4 (Geisler et al., 2005, Lewis et al., 2007, Blakeslee et al., 2007, Rahman et al., 2010). Upon reaching the elongation zone on the bottom side of the root, the increased auxin concentration restricts cellular elongation. The shootward auxin flow is then redirected laterally back towards the vasculature and then the rootward to the QC creating a ‘reflux loop’ mediated by PIN2, PIN3 and PIN7 (Friml, 2003, Benková et al., 2003, Ikram et al., 2005). Upon gravi-stimulation, the fast alkalization of the cytoplasm has been proposed to be a major factor involved in the positioning of PIN proteins as mutants that are defective in gravity-induced columella cell alkalinization also fail to show PIN relocalization (Boonsirichai et al., 2003, Harrison and Masson, 2008).

Auxin binds to one of two proposed classes of receptors, the AUXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1(ABP1) receptor or the TRANSPORT-INHIBITOR-RESISTANT 1(TIR1)/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (AFB) proteins (Stefan and Ottoline, 2005, Nihal et al., 2005). After auxin binds the TIR1/AFB complex it activates SCF ubiquitin ligase complex that targets proteins for degradation such as the Auxin Response Factor (ARF) transcription factor family (Badescu and Napier, 2006). Many quantitative and qualitative factors determine how each cell will respond to auxin gradients along a tissue or across an organ such as the post-transcriptional modification of regulatory proteins, changes to their expression profile, changes to their stability and the varying affinity of the various receptor heterodimers. The regulation of non-transcriptional auxin signaling such as the aforementioned Rop-GTPase control over cytoskeletal stability is in part mediated by ABP1. However, ABP1 can also influence the expression of TIR1/AFB-mediated auxin-responsive gene demonstrating the integration of these two signaling networks which may coordinate both cell division and cell expansion (Shi and Yang, 2011).

Phosphorylation of PIN proteins has been shown to be an important mechanism involved in the regulation of their activity and polar localization by using kinase inhibitors to disrupt PIN2 localization (Sukumar et al., 2009). PINOID is a kinase that has been shown to have altered PIN protein cycling impairing the plants ability to respond to gravity (Friml et al., 2004). The protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex also regulates PIN localization by phosphorylating PIN proteins and inhibiting PINOID induced phosphorylation (Michniewicz et al., 2007). PINOID increases the rootward localization of PINs while PP2A promotes the shootward localization. In addition, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)has been shown to be capable of transphosphorylation of PINOID resulting in enhanced autophosphorylation and increased PINOID activity (Zegzouti et al., 2006). Recently the function of PINOID has been explored mathematically _insilico_ to try to provide insights into its behavior in steady-state scenarios and during dynamic Time-dependent simulations (Fozard et al., 2013). Fozard et al., 2013 provide these conceptual PINOID models along with one that explains the polarized recycling of PIN proteins providing a mathematical description of PIN behavior observed experimentally (Fozard et al., 2013).

PIN proteins are also regulated by GTPases, which are themselves regulated by GDP/GTP exchange factors (GEF) which remove GDP from the GTPase active site and allow GTP to rebind to it (Geldner et al., 2003). GNOM is a GTPase that regulates vesicle trafficking by controlling the activity of ADP-ribosylation-factor family (ARF) GTPases which influence the localization of PIN3 and PIN7 in the columella cells. Mutant _gnom_ alleles or chemicals that interfere with GNOM function such as brefeldin A have a reduced capacity to respond to gravity highlighting the importance of correct PIN localization (Geldner et al., 2003). SPIKE1 is another GEF that has been shown to be involved in PIN trafficking during gravitropism, the _spike1-1_ mutant plant has enhanced sensitivity to brefeldin A and a reduced accumulation of PIN2 on the lower membrane of gravistiumlated roots (Lin et al., 2012).

### PIN regulation and hormonal interactions <a href="#wrsgrrrkmpgq" id="wrsgrrrkmpgq"></a>

Although many auxin transporters have important functions that allow plants to respond to being reoriented, only PIN3 and PIN7 that have been shown have their localization shifted to the lower side of the root cap columella cells initiating a differential auxin flow towards the lower side of the root (Friml et al., 2002b, Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010). It has been shown that PIN proteins are regulated by dynamic subcellular endocytic recycling systems linking the plasma membrane to pre-vacuolar compartments and lytic vacuoles for degradation, thus PIN abundance can be regulated by transcriptional changes or modifications to subcellular trafficking (Lindy et al., 2006, Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008, Robert et al., 2010). The localization of PIN proteins can control the direction of auxin flow while the overall abundance of auxin transports influences total auxin flux rates. Recent experiments have shown they are regulated by multiple hormonal signals allowing integration many internal and environmental signals. While auxin plays a crucial role in gravitropism, as the presence of auxin in a cell promotes its own export potentially driving a positive feedback loop in positive environments. Other phytohormones are also involved potentially in translating environmental signals into growth response by altering auxin transport dynamics. Brassinosteroids have been implemented in the transcriptional regulation of PIN4 and PIN7 (Nakamura et al., 2004), while cytokinin have been shown to influence PIN1, PIN2, PIN3 and PIN7 expression (Růžička et al., 2009) and it has been shown that ethylene can promote PIN2 and AUX1 expression (Růžička et al., 2007). However, the regulation of PIN proteins is not only at the transcriptional level as has been recently demonstrated cytokinins modulation of endocytic PIN1 trafficking (Marhavý et al., 2011) and gibberellins (GA) regulation of PIN protein stability (Willige et al., 2011, Löfke et al., 2013). It has also been suggested that GA may also be asymmetrically distributed after a gravitropic stimulus, although it is likely that this is downstream of auxin signalling, it still provides another useful feedback mechanism that can integrate various environmental signals (Cui et al., 2005, Wolbang et al., 2007).

A recent advance in our understanding of auxin transport and signalling dynamics has been achieved using the temporally sensitive an Aux/IAA based reporter, domain II (DII) attached to a fast folder GFP variant known as VENUS, the DII-VENUS reporter which was used to investigate the redistribution of auxin after Arabidopsis seedlings were reoriented 90° (Band et al., 2012c).  Band _et al_., (2012) used the DII-VENUS reporter to demonstrate that after the root had started reorienting, the auxin gradient disappears after the root had turned only 40° demonstrating that the final stages of root reorientation are achieved without the presence of an auxin gradient. Interestingly, this is the angle where the statoliths come into contact with the rootward tip of the columella cell suggesting that root growth resetting to a pre-gravi-stimulated state post gravity signal response and may resemble a digital tipping switch that is activated when the root-tip angle reaches 45° (Band et al., 2012c). However, this model does explain how root reorientation can occur at angles as low as 15° (Mullen et al., 2000).

### Differential auxin gradients effect cell wall organization <a href="#nycmzgfuzddj" id="nycmzgfuzddj"></a>

This ambiguity is related to the interphase CMT arrays forming a link between the plasma membrane and the cell wall allowing the integration of signals from both inside the cell and from its external environment (Cyr, 1994, Fisher and Cyr, 1998). The role that cortical microtubules plays in aligning cellulose microfibrils was explored by Baskin _et al_., (2004) by adding the microtubule inhibitor Oryzalin. The effect on cell expansion was observed by cryofixation of the samples which were then embedded in plastic and observed with polarized light and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The changing pattern of the microtubule distribution and their distance from the tip were recorded. Microtubule distribution within the elongation zone was shown to be transverse to the direction of growth, however the addition of Oryzalin disorganized the arrays and slowed the growth of the plant. Close subcellular inspection revealed good correlation between CMT arrays and cellulose microfibrils in both the control and oryzalin treated roots. However, the orientation of the microtubules was more disorganized in the oryzalin treated sample(Baskin et al., 2004). This demonstrates that cortical microtubules are capable of aligning cellulose microfilaments in the cell wall modulating cell expansion. The complex structure of the cellulose microfibrils has hindered research, however the new Micro Filament analyzer, now provides a high-throughput method to quantify the orientation of the filamentous microfibrils (Jacques et al., 2013). They used the GFP tagged MAP-4 to visualize the microtubules within the root tip (Marc et al., 1998), the confocal microscope images were then analyzed using the Micro Filament Analyzer demonstrating that microfibril orientation are more random close to the root tip (distance from QC 200-399µM) and become more transversely orientated later in development when the cells enter the elongation zone (distance from QC 400-599 µM) (Jacques et al., 2013). Jacques _et al.,_ (2013) then rotated the seedlings 90o and were able to quantify the difference in microtubule orientation between the top and bottom of the root revealing that the top had more transversely orientated microfibrils while the bottom had more randomly orientated ones. This tool will make the screening for cell wall organization mutants easier for future mutant screens.

The orientation of the load-bearing cellulose microfibrils regulate cell shape by the cytoskeleton (Paredez et al., 2006), this is highlighted by treatments that cause root skewing phenotypes due to interactions between the cortical microtubules within the cytosol and the cellulose microfibrils biosynthesis at the cell membrane (Baskin, 2001, Paredez et al., 2006). The MICROTUBULE ORGANIZATION 1 (MOR1) gene encodes a protein that is essential for microtubule organization and stability. The _mor1_ mutant has been used to show that inhibiting microtubule assembly impairs growth due to cells expanding radially instead of longitudinally (Whittington et al., 2001). The formation, disappearance and movement of microtubules is an extremely dynamic process, and mutations within the tubulin intradimer interface of α-tubulins 4 and 6 reduces microtubule stability, ultimately resulting in a left-handed helical growth pattern in roots (Thitamadee et al., 2002). ERH3 is a katanin protein that is known to sever microtubules as part of the regulation of cell expansion. Mutants with defective versions of this gene have defective walls that instead of having transversely orientated microtubules, have randomly orientated microtubules but only within the cortical cells of the elongation zone, which ultimately results in plants with shorter hairier roots (Webb et al., 2002). There are two types of tubulin α and β, which are encoded by a large and functionally redundant family of genes. As skewing depends on the perception of a combination of environmental stimuli it constitutes a more complex response that is the product of interactions between gravity, touch and other surface-derived stimuli.

In fact, some of these mutations affect MT dynamic instability in different ways. Also, several other treatments, such as transgenic lines expressing GFP-tagged versions of microtubule associated proteins, have been used to investigate the effect of MT dynamic instability on cell expansion and growth behavior. They should be included in this discussion as well.
